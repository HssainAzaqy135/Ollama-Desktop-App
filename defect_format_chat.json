      "content": "Python is an excellent language to learn, and it's widely used in many areas of computer science. Its simplicity, readability, and versatility make it a great choice for beginners and experts alike.\n\nC++ is also a powerful language, known for its performance, reliability, and flexibility. It's often used in systems programming, game development, and high-performance applications.\n\nIt sounds like you have a good foundation in both languages. Have you had any opportunities to work on projects that combine Python and C++? Or perhaps you're interested in exploring other areas of computer science, such as data science, machine learning, or web development?\n\nBy the way, what motivated you to choose computer science as your major? Was it a particular interest in coding, problem-solving, or something else?"
